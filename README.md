# pefinder containers

We're making some edits to this container set, so that we can open the PEFinder from a website using Flask. This has only been done to the Docker Container. 

This repository builds a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/vanessa/pefinder/) and a [Singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov) image, each that will run PE-Finder to produce output for some input data file. If you are working on your local machine, you can use either Docker or Singularity. If you are running in a shared cluster (HPC) environment where you do not have root permissions, Singularity is your best option. Instructions are included for both.

Packages that need to be installed (e.g. seaborn and radnlp) have versions specified in case a future change breaks this code, you can see this in the top section of the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

# Singularity

## 1. Install Singularity

Instructions can be found on the [singularity site](https://singularityware.github.io).

## 2. Bootstrap the image
Bootstrapping means using something to build from, or not starting from nothing. In this case, we are going to use a build file that bootstraps a Docker image of the PE Finder (yes, the same one discussed shortly after). This build file is called [Singularity](Singularity), and for more details about this you can [read here](http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-docker).

    sudo singularity create --size 6000 pefinder.img
    sudo singularity bootstrap pefinder.img Singularity


## 3. Run commands
The entry to the container is done simply by using it as an executable:


	./pefinder.img --help
	INFO:pefinder:radnlp version 0.2.0.8
	usage: cli.py [-h] --reports REPORTS [--report_field REPORT_FIELD]
		      [--id_field ID_FIELD] [--result_field RESULT_FIELD]
		      [--delim DELIM] --output OUTPUT [--no-remap]
		      [--run {mark,classify}]

	generate predictions for PE for a set of reports (impressions)

	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  --reports REPORTS     Path to folder of reports, or tab separated text file
	  --report_field REPORT_FIELD
		                the header column that contains the text of interest
		                (default is report_text)
	  --id_field ID_FIELD   the header column that contains the id of the report
		                (default is report_id)
	  --result_field RESULT_FIELD
		                the field to save pefinder (chapman) result to, not
		                saved unless --no-remap is specified.
	  --delim DELIM         the delimiter separating the input reports data.
		                Default is tab (\t)
	  --output OUTPUT       Desired output file (.tsv)
	  --no-remap            don't remap multilabel PEFinder result to Stanford
		                labels
	  --run {mark,classify}
		                mark (mark), or classify (classify) reports.

You are minimally going to need to provide `--reports`, and `--output`, which assumes that the report text is in a column called `report_text`, the report id is in a column called `report_id`, and you want to perform all actions (mark and classify) as the default for the `--run` command. The most basic running command we will use looks like this:


      singularity run -B $PWD:/data pefinder.img --reports /data/pefinder/data/stanford_data.csv --delim , --output /data/result.tsv


The `-B` argument means "bind" and it says that we want to bind the present working directory (`$PWD`) to the folder in the container called `/data`. We do this so that we can read and write to `/data` in the container, and the result will appear in our present working directory. Note that the `--reports` input is also relative to `/data`, meaning that the input is located at `$PWD/pefinder/data/stanford_reports.csv`. The `--output` variable, then, is relative to inside of the container. By writing to `/data/result.tsv` we are going to see the file `result.tsv` appear in our `$PWD` because of the volume. See the section below, Input Arguments, for more detail on the runtime executable.

## How do I shell into the container?
Singularity has an easy, intuitive way to shell inside!

      singularity shell pefinder.img

If you want the container to be writable (default isn't) then you will need root (on your local machine) and add the `--writable` option:

      sudo singularity shell --writable pefinder.img
      Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...
      Singularity.pefinder.img> cd /code
      Singularity.pefinder.img> ls
      Dockerfile  README.md	 docker-compose.yml  pefinder
      LICENSE     Singularity  docs

# Docker

## Getting Started
You should first [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/). The container is provided on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vanessa/pefinder/) and can be downloaded from there when you run it, however if you want to look at or make changes to the code, it's recommended to clone the repo and build the container locally:

    git clone http://www.github.com/vsoch/pe-predictive
    cd pe-predictive
    docker build -t vanessa/pefinder .


## Analyzing Reports
The function of the container is to take reports and produce a `.tsv` file with PEFinder classifications. Let's first run the container with the `--help` argument to see what arguments are needed:


	docker run vanessa/pefinder --help
	INFO:pefinder:radnlp version 0.2.0.8
	usage: cli.py [-h] --reports REPORTS [--report_field REPORT_FIELD]
		      [--id_field ID_FIELD] [--result_field RESULT_FIELD] --output
		      OUTPUT [--no-remap] [--run {mark,classify}]

	generate predictions for PE for a set of reports (impressions)

	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  --reports REPORTS     Path to folder of reports, or tab separated text file
	  --report_field REPORT_FIELD
		                the header column that contains the text of interest
		                (default is report_text)
	  --id_field ID_FIELD   the header column that contains the id of the report
		                (default is report_id)
	  --result_field RESULT_FIELD
		                the field to save pefinder (chapman) result to, not
		                saved unless --no-remap is specified.
	  --delim DELIM         the delimiter separating the input reports data.
		                Default is tab (\t)
	  --output OUTPUT       Desired output file (.tsv)
	  --verbose             Print more verbose output (useful for analyzing more
		                reports)
	  --no-remap            don't remap multilabel PEFinder result to Stanford
		                labels
	  --run {classify,mark}
		                mark (mark), or classify (classify) reports.


You are minimally going to need to provide `--reports`, and `--output`, which assumes that the report text is in a column called `report_text`, the report id is in a column called `report_id`, and you want to perform all actions (mark and classify) as the default for the `--run` command. If you have a lot of reports, it is recommended to use the `--verbose` flag to give you a countdown of classifications remaining. The most basic running command we will use looks like this:


      docker run -v $PWD:/data vanessa/pefinder --reports /data/pefinder/data/stanford_data.csv --delim , --output /data/stanford_result.tsv


The `-v` argument means "volume" and it says that we want to map the present working directory (`$PWD`) to the folder in the container called `/data`. We do this so that we can read and write to `/data` in the container, and the result will appear in our present working directory. Otherwise, the result would remain in the container and we wouldn't have easy access to it. Note that the `--reports` input is also relative to `/data`, meaning that the input is located at `$PWD/pefinder/data/stanford_reports.csv`. The `--output` variable, then, is relative to inside of the container. By writing to `/data/stanford_result.tsv` we are going to see the file `stanford_result.tsv` appear in our `$PWD` because of the volume. 


## How do I shell into the container?
By default, running the container uses the `ENTRYPOINT`, meaning it is used as an executable and you do not enter the container. In the case that you want a container-based environment that is installed with the dependencies of PEFinder, or if you want to interactively work with the code, you may want to shell into the container. If there is a running container (eg an analysis) and you want to open up another terminal on your local machine to look inside (while it's running!) you need to get the 12 digit identifier with `docker ps`, and then plug it into this command:

      docker exec -it dc70464c6eb5 bash

This says we want to execute (exec) and (interactive)(terminal) for container with id (af21bf1d48a6) and run the command (bash)

If the container isn't running, then you can use `run`:

      docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/sh vanessa/pefinder

Now, let's talk about what your options are for your reports input data.


# Input arguments

### Reports
For your input data, you have two options:

1. *Folder*: a folder of raw text files, with each text file name assumed to be the report id, and the entire content the impression part of the report to analyze.
2. *File*: a single tab separated (`.tsv`) file with some field for the report text (default is assumed to be `report_text`) and report id (default is `report_id`).


### What if I want to change defaults?

- If you need to change the delimiter, specify it with the argument `--delim`
- If you need to change the default report text column name, specify it with the argument `--report_field`
- If you need to change the default report id column name, specify it with the argument `--report_id`


## Examples
For each of the examples, the equivalent Docker and Singularity commands are provided.

### Classifying Reports
Classifying reports means marking and classification. This is default.

        # Docker
	docker run -v $PWD:/data vanessa/pefinder --reports /data/pefinder/data/stanford_data.csv --delim , --output /data/stanford_result.tsv

        # Singularity
        singularity run -B $PWD:/data pefinder.img --reports /data/pefinder/data/stanford_data.csv --delim , --output /data/stanford_result.tsv

	INFO:pefinder:radnlp version 0.2.0.8
	INFO:pefinder:
	***STARTING PE-FINDER CONTAINER****
	INFO:pefinder:Will use column report_text as report text.
	INFO:pefinder:Will use column report_id as report id.
	INFO:pefinder:reports path provided is /data/pefinder/data/stanford_data.csv
	INFO:pefinder:Analyzing 117816 reports, please wait...

Adding `--run classify` would do the equivalent.


### Marking Reports
This is an intermediate step that won't give you classification labels. You might do this to look at the data. The markup is output in the field `markup` of the results file.

        # Docker
	docker run -v $PWD:/data vanessa/pefinder --run mark --reports /data/pefinder/data/stanford_data.csv --delim , --output /data/stanford_result.tsv

        # Singularity
        singularity run -B $PWD:/data pefinder.img --run mark --reports /data/pefinder/data/stanford_data.csv --delim , --output /data/stanford_result.tsv


### Classifying Reports
This is the final step to classify the markup (the `markup` column of your input data) and produce the classification. If you just want this classification, you should run the first example, Analyzing Reports.


        # Docker
	docker run -v $PWD:/data vanessa/pefinder --run classify --reports /data/pefinder/data/stanford_data.csv --delim , --output /data/stanford_result.tsv

        # Singularity
        singularity run -B $PWD:/data pefinder.img --run classify --reports /data/pefinder/data/stanford_data.csv --delim , --output /data/stanford_result.tsv



## Why?
By "shipping" analyses in packages, meaning having a specification of all dependencies (python modules, data, etc.) we can be assured that the next person that runs our analysis will not run into system-specific differences. They won't have to install python or anaconda to run our notebook, and get a weird message about having the wrong kernel. They just need Docker, and then to run the image, and that's it. This is an important feature of reproducible workflows and analyses, and every piece of code that you work on (and tend to share) should have features like this.
